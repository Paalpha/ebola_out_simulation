## Comparison of machine learning methods for estimating case fatality ratios: An Ebola outbreak simulation study.
Using simulated data, we use a ML algorithmic framework to evaluate data imputation performance and the resulting case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates, focusing on the scale and type of data missingness (i.e., missing completely at random - MCAR, missing at random â€“ MAR, or missing not at random - MNAR).
